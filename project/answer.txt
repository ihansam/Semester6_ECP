{'100lines_short_adventuresOfHuckleberryFinn_MarkTwain': "YOU don't know about me without you have read a book by the name of The\nAdventures of Tom Sawyer; but that ain't no matter. ?That book was made\nby Mr. Mark Twain, and he told the truth, mainly. ?There was things\nwhich he stretched, but mainly he told the truth. ?That is nothing. ?I\nnever seen anybody but lied one time or another, without it was Aunt\nPolly, or the widow, or maybe Mary. ?Aunt Polly--Tom's Aunt Polly, she\nis--and Mary, and the Widow Douglas is all told about in that book, which\nis mostly a true book, with some stretchers, as I said before.\n\nNow the way that the book winds up is this: ?Tom and me found the money\nthat the robbers hid in the cave, and it made us rich. ?We got six\nthousand dollars apiece--all gold. ?It was an awful sight of money when\nit was piled up. ?Well, Judge Thatcher he took it and put it out\nat interest, and it fetched us a dollar a day apiece all the year\nround--more than a body could tell what to do with. ?The Widow Douglas\nshe took me for her son, and allowed she would sivilize me; but it was\nrough living in the house all the time, considering how dismal regular\nand decent the widow was in all her ways; and so when I couldn't stand\nit no longer I lit out. ?I got into my old rags and my sugar-hogshead\nagain, and was free and satisfied. ?But Tom Sawyer he hunted me up and\nsaid he was going to start a band of robbers, and I might join if I\nwould go back to the widow and be respectable. ?So I went back.\n\nThe widow she cried over me, and called me a poor lost lamb, and she\ncalled me a lot of other names, too, but she never meant no harm by\nit. She put me in them new clothes again, and I couldn't do nothing but\nsweat and sweat, and feel all cramped up. ?Well, then, the old thing\ncommenced again. ?The widow rung a bell for supper, and you had to come\nto time. When you got to the table you couldn't go right to eating, but\nyou had to wait for the widow to tuck down her head and grumble a little\nover the victuals, though there warn't really anything the matter with\nthem,--that is, nothing only everything was cooked by itself. ?In a\nbarrel of odds and ends it is different; things get mixed up, and the\njuice kind of swaps around, and the things go better.\n\nAfter supper she got out her book and learned me about Moses and the\nBulrushers, and I was in a sweat to find out all about him; but by and\nby she let it out that Moses had been dead a considerable long time; so\nthen I didn't care no more about him, because I don't take no stock in\ndead people.\n\nPretty soon I wanted to smoke, and asked the widow to let me. ?But she\nwouldn't. ?She said it was a mean practice and wasn't clean, and I must\ntry to not do it any more. ?That is just the way with some people. ?They\nget down on a thing when they don't know nothing about it. ?Here she was\na-bothering about Moses, which was no kin to her, and no use to anybody,\nbeing gone, you see, yet finding a power of fault with me for doing a\nthing that had some good in it. ?And she took snuff, too; of course that\nwas all right, because she done it herself.\n\nHer sister, Miss Watson, a tolerable slim old maid, with goggles on,\nhad just come to live with her, and took a set at me now with a\nspelling-book. She worked me middling hard for about an hour, and then\nthe widow made her ease up. ?I couldn't stood it much longer. ?Then for\nan hour it was deadly dull, and I was fidgety. ?Miss Watson would say,\n¡°Don't put your feet up there, Huckleberry;¡± and ¡°Don't scrunch up\nlike that, Huckleberry--set up straight;¡± and pretty soon she would\nsay, ¡°Don't gap and stretch like that, Huckleberry--why don't you try to\nbehave?¡± ?Then she told me all about the bad place, and I said I wished\nI was there. She got mad then, but I didn't mean no harm. ?All I wanted\nwas to go somewheres; all I wanted was a change, I warn't particular.\n?She said it was wicked to say what I said; said she wouldn't say it for\nthe whole world; she was going to live so as to go to the good place.\n?Well, I couldn't see no advantage in going where she was going, so I\nmade up my mind I wouldn't try for it. ?But I never said so, because it\nwould only make trouble, and wouldn't do no good.\n\nNow she had got a start, and she went on and told me all about the good\nplace. ?She said all a body would have to do there was to go around all\nday long with a harp and sing, forever and ever. ?So I didn't think\nmuch of it. But I never said so. ?I asked her if she reckoned Tom Sawyer\nwould go there, and she said not by a considerable sight. ?I was glad\nabout that, because I wanted him and me to be together.\n\nMiss Watson she kept pecking at me, and it got tiresome and lonesome.\n?By and by they fetched the niggers in and had prayers, and then\neverybody was off to bed. ?I went up to my room with a piece of candle,\nand put it on the table. ?Then I set down in a chair by the window and\ntried to think of something cheerful, but it warn't no use. ?I felt\nso lonesome I most wished I was dead. ?The stars were shining, and the\nleaves rustled in the woods ever so mournful; and I heard an owl, away\noff, who-whooing about somebody that was dead, and a whippowill and a\ndog crying about somebody that was going to die; and the wind was trying\nto whisper something to me, and I couldn't make out what it was, and so\nit made the cold shivers run over me. Then away out in the woods I heard\nthat kind of a sound that a ghost makes when it wants to tell about\nsomething that's on its mind and can't make itself understood, and so\ncan't rest easy in its grave, and has to go about that way every night\ngrieving. ?I got so down-hearted and scared I did wish I had some\ncompany. ?Pretty soon a spider went crawling up my shoulder, and I\nflipped it off and it lit in the candle; and before I could budge it\nwas all shriveled up. ?I didn't need anybody to tell me that that was\nan awful bad sign and would fetch me some bad luck, so I was scared\nand most shook the clothes off of me. I got up and turned around in my\ntracks three times and crossed my breast every time; and then I tied\nup a little lock of my hair with a thread to keep witches away. ?But\nI hadn't no confidence. ?You do that when you've lost a horseshoe that\nyou've found, instead of nailing it up over the door, but I hadn't ever\nheard anybody say it was any way to keep off bad luck when you'd killed\na spider.", '10lines_emma_JaneAusten': " Mr. Knightley, a sensible man about seven or eight-and-thirty, was not\nonly a very old and intimate friend of the family, but particularly\nconnected with it, as the elder brother of Isabella's husband. He lived\nabout a mile from Highbury, was a frequent visitor, and always welcome,\nand at this time more welcome than usual, as coming directly from their\nmutual connexions in London. He had returned to a late dinner, after\nsome days' absence, and now walked up to Hartfield to say that all were\nwell in Brunswick Square.

He pulled\nup the blind and rang the bell loudly. It was at once answered by the\nappearance of an old friend, his valet, Matvey, carrying his clothes,\nhis boots, and a telegram. Matvey was followed by the barber with all\nthe necessaries for shaving.\n\n¡°Are there any papers from the office?¡± asked Stepan Arkadyevitch,\ntaking the telegram and seating himself at the looking-glass.\n\n¡°On the table,¡± replied Matvey, glancing with inquiring sympathy at his\nmaster; and, after a short pause, he added with a sly smile, ¡°They¡¯ve\nsent from the carriage-jobbers.¡±\n\nStepan Arkadyevitch made no reply, he merely glanced at Matvey in the\nlooking-glass. In the glance, in which their eyes met in the\nlooking-glass, it was clear that they understood one another. Stepan\nArkadyevitch¡¯s eyes asked: ¡°Why do you tell me that? don¡¯t you know?¡±\n\nMatvey put his hands in his jacket pockets, thrust out one leg, and\ngazed silently, good-humoredly, with a faint smile, at his master.\n\n¡°I told them to come on Sunday, and till then not to trouble you or\nthemselves for nothing,¡± he said. He had obviously prepared the\nsentence beforehand.\n\nStepan Arkadyevitch saw Matvey wanted to make a joke and attract\nattention to himself. Tearing open the telegram, he read it through,\nguessing at the words, misspelt as they always are in telegrams, and\nhis face brightened.\n\n¡°Matvey, my sister Anna Arkadyevna will be here tomorrow,¡± he said,\nchecking for a minute the sleek, plump hand of the barber, cutting a\npink path through his long, curly whiskers.\n\n¡°Thank God!¡± said Matvey, showing by this response that he, like his\nmaster, realized the significance of this arrival?that is, that Anna\nArkadyevna, the sister he was so fond of, might bring about a\nreconciliation between husband and wife.\n\n¡°Alone, or with her husband?¡± inquired Matvey.\n\nStepan Arkadyevitch could not answer, as the barber was at work on his\nupper lip, and he raised one finger. Matvey nodded at the\nlooking-glass.\n\n¡°Alone. Is the room to be got ready upstairs?¡±\n\n¡°Inform Darya Alexandrovna: where she orders.¡±\n\n¡°Darya Alexandrovna?¡± Matvey repeated, as though in doubt.\n\n¡°Yes, inform her. Here, take the telegram; give it to her, and then do\nwhat she tells you.¡±\n\n¡°You want to try it on,¡± Matvey understood, but he only said, ¡°Yes,\nsir.¡±\n\nStepan Arkadyevitch was already washed and combed and ready to be\ndressed, when Matvey, stepping deliberately in his creaky boots, came\nback into the room with the telegram in his hand. The barber had gone.\n\n¡°Darya Alexandrovna told me to inform you that she is going away. Let\nhim do?that is you?as he likes,¡± he said, laughing only with his eyes,\nand putting his hands in his pockets, he watched his master with his\nhead on one side. Stepan Arkadyevitch was silent a minute. Then a\ngood-humored and rather pitiful smile showed itself on his handsome\nface.\n\n¡°Eh, Matvey?¡± he said, shaking his head.\n\n¡°It¡¯s all right, sir; she will come round,¡± said Matvey.\n\n¡°Come round?¡±\n\n¡°Yes, sir.¡±\n\n¡°Do you think so? Who¡¯s there?¡± asked Stepan Arkadyevitch, hearing the\nrustle of a woman¡¯s dress at the door.\n\n¡°It¡¯s I,¡± said a firm, pleasant, woman¡¯s voice, and the stern,\npockmarked face of Matrona Philimonovna, the nurse, was thrust in at\nthe doorway.\n\n¡°Well, what is it, Matrona?¡± queried Stepan Arkadyevitch, going up to\nher at the door.\n\nAlthough Stepan Arkadyevitch was completely in the wrong as regards his\nwife, and was conscious of this himself, almost everyone in the house\n(even the nurse, Darya Alexandrovna¡¯s chief ally) was on his side.\n\n¡°Well, what now?¡± he asked disconsolately.', '99lines_short_aTaleOfTwoCities_CharlesDickens': "All these things, and a thousand like them, came to pass in and close\nupon the dear old year one thousand seven hundred and seventy-five.\nEnvironed by them, while the Woodman and the Farmer worked unheeded,\nthose two of the large jaws, and those other two of the plain and the\nfair faces, trod with stir enough, and carried their divine rights\nwith a high hand. Thus did the year one thousand seven hundred\nand seventy-five conduct their Greatnesses, and myriads of small\ncreatures--the creatures of this chronicle among the rest--along the\nroads that lay before them.\n\n\n\n\nII. The Mail\n\n\nIt was the Dover road that lay, on a Friday night late in November,\nbefore the first of the persons with whom this history has business.\nThe Dover road lay, as to him, beyond the Dover mail, as it lumbered up\nShooter's Hill. He walked up hill in the mire by the side of the mail,\nas the rest of the passengers did; not because they had the least relish\nfor walking exercise, under the circumstances, but because the hill,\nand the harness, and the mud, and the mail, were all so heavy, that the\nhorses had three times already come to a stop, besides once drawing the\ncoach across the road, with the mutinous intent of taking it back\nto Blackheath. Reins and whip and coachman and guard, however, in\ncombination, had read that article of war which forbade a purpose\notherwise strongly in favour of the argument, that some brute animals\nare endued with Reason; and the team had capitulated and returned to\ntheir duty.\n\nWith drooping heads and tremulous tails, they mashed their way through\nthe thick mud, floundering and stumbling between whiles, as if they were\nfalling to pieces at the larger joints. As often as the driver rested\nthem and brought them to a stand, with a wary ¡°Wo-ho! so-ho-then!¡± the\nnear leader violently shook his head and everything upon it--like an\nunusually emphatic horse, denying that the coach could be got up the\nhill. Whenever the leader made this rattle, the passenger started, as a\nnervous passenger might, and was disturbed in mind.\n\nThere was a steaming mist in all the hollows, and it had roamed in its\nforlornness up the hill, like an evil spirit, seeking rest and finding\nnone. A clammy and intensely cold mist, it made its slow way through the\nair in ripples that visibly followed and overspread one another, as the\nwaves of an unwholesome sea might do. It was dense enough to shut out\neverything from the light of the coach-lamps but these its own workings,\nand a few yards of road; and the reek of the labouring horses steamed\ninto it, as if they had made it all.\n\nTwo other passengers, besides the one, were plodding up the hill by the\nside of the mail. All three were wrapped to the cheekbones and over the\nears, and wore jack-boots. Not one of the three could have said, from\nanything he saw, what either of the other two was like; and each was\nhidden under almost as many wrappers from the eyes of the mind, as from\nthe eyes of the body, of his two companions. In those days, travellers\nwere very shy of being confidential on a short notice, for anybody on\nthe road might be a robber or in league with robbers. As to the latter,\nwhen every posting-house and ale-house could produce somebody in\n¡°the Captain's¡± pay, ranging from the landlord to the lowest stable\nnon-descript, it was the likeliest thing upon the cards. So the guard\nof the Dover mail thought to himself, that Friday night in November, one\nthousand seven hundred and seventy-five, lumbering up Shooter's Hill, as\nhe stood on his own particular perch behind the mail, beating his feet,\nand keeping an eye and a hand on the arm-chest before him, where a\nloaded blunderbuss lay at the top of six or eight loaded horse-pistols,\ndeposited on a substratum of cutlass.\n\nThe Dover mail was in its usual genial position that the guard suspected\nthe passengers, the passengers suspected one another and the guard, they\nall suspected everybody else, and the coachman was sure of nothing but\nthe horses; as to which cattle he could with a clear conscience have\ntaken his oath on the two Testaments that they were not fit for the\njourney.\n\n¡°Wo-ho!¡± said the coachman. ¡°So, then! One more pull and you're at the\ntop and be damned to you, for I have had trouble enough to get you to\nit!--Joe!¡±\n\n¡°Halloa!¡± the guard replied.\n\n¡°What o'clock do you make it, Joe?¡±\n\n¡°Ten minutes, good, past eleven.¡±\n\n¡°My blood!¡± ejaculated the vexed coachman, ¡°and not atop of Shooter's\nyet! Tst! Yah! Get on with you!¡±\n\nThe emphatic horse, cut short by the whip in a most decided negative,\nmade a decided scramble for it, and the three other horses followed\nsuit. Once more, the Dover mail struggled on, with the jack-boots of its\npassengers squashing along by its side. They had stopped when the coach\nstopped, and they kept close company with it. If any one of the three\nhad had the hardihood to propose to another to walk on a little ahead\ninto the mist and darkness, he would have put himself in a fair way of\ngetting shot instantly as a highwayman.\n\nThe last burst carried the mail to the summit of the hill. The horses\nstopped to breathe again, and the guard got down to skid the wheel for\nthe descent, and open the coach-door to let the passengers in."}
